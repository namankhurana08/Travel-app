# Travel App
Our Travel App provides a personalized experience by allowing users to explore various travel destinations through interactive cards. Each card presents a unique travel option with relevant details and imagery, helping users find inspiration for their next adventure.

### Key Features:
Customizable Card Interface:

The app displays a series of cards, each representing a different travel destination or activity. Users can easily remove cards that do not match their interests by swiping them away or tapping a delete button. This allows for a streamlined and personalized browsing experience tailored to individual preferences.

Dynamic Refresh Option:

If all cards are removed, a Refresh button will automatically appear, giving users the option to reload all the travel cards back to the screen. This feature ensures that users can quickly explore more options without having to restart the app or perform any complex navigation steps.
Smooth User Experience:

The app is designed to provide a smooth and intuitive user experience. With easy-to-use gestures and clean, attractive visuals, users can enjoy a seamless journey through potential travel adventures.

### How to Use:
Explore Destinations: Start by browsing through the available travel destination cards. Swipe or tap to remove any cards that do not interest you.
Refresh the Cards: Once all cards are removed, a Refresh button will pop up. Click on it to reload the cards and explore new or previous options again.

With this intuitive card-based system and the ability to refresh content dynamically, our Travel App makes finding your next destination an engaging and personalized experience!
